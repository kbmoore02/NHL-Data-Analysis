## About the Data

The data I will be analyzing in this project comes from a voluntary survey given to all BYU students who took Stat 121 in Fall 2023. This dataset has 1097 observations of 34 variables, 16 of which are categorical and 18 of which are numeric. The variables are as follows:
-	College: what sub-college at BYU the student is in (Business, Education, CPMS, Nursing, CFAC, Life, FHSS, Engineering, Humanities)
-	SemestersTillGrad: how many more semesters until the student graduates
-	AttendDevos: if the student attends campus devotionals
-	InRelationship: if the student is in a relationship
-	UsedDatingApp: if the student has used any dating app
-	AppleOrAndroid: whether the student uses apple of android
-	MacOrPC: whether the student has a Mac or a PC
-	Diet: what kind of diet the student has (Omnivore, Vegan, Paleo, Keto, Vegetarian)
-	FoodPerWeek: how much money the student spend on food each week, in dollars
-	Height: student height in inches
-	MotherHeight: student’s mother’s height in inches
-	FatherHeight: student’s father’s height in inches
-	Sex: student sex (Male, Female)
-	ShoeSize: student shoe size
-	SportsInHS: if the student played sports in high school
-	AI: if the student uses AI to complete assignments
-	HoursSleep: how much sleep the student gets each night, in hours
-	MusicGenre: the student’s favorite genre of music (Country, Hip-hop and Rap, Pop, Classical, Rock and Metal, Dance and Electronic, Other)
-	TuitionPerSemester: how much tuition the student pays each semester, in dollars
-	Credits: how many credits the student is taking this semester
-	HighSchoolGPA: the student’s high school grade point average
-	Job: if the student currently has a job
-	NumberOfSiblings: how many siblings the student has
-	FutureHome: where the student eventually wants to settle down (West, Northeast, Midwest, South, International)
-	HoursHomework: how long the student spends on homework each week, in hours
-	SocialMediaApp: the student’s preferred social media app (Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Tik Tok, YouTube, Facebook)
-	MovieGenre: the student’s favorite movie genre (Action, Comedy, Romance, Drama, Mystery, Fantasy, Horror, Foreign)
-	Subscriptions: which streaming service subscription the student uses most often (Apple TV, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, None)
-	AgeSantaClaus: what age the student learned the truth about Santa, in years
-	YearInternet: what year the student thinks the internet was invented
-	BYUFounded: what year the student thinks BYU was founded
-	YHowTall: how tall the student thinks Y Mountain is
-	Salary: the student’s desired future salary, in dollars

My primary research goal is to see if I can predict a BYU student's favorite genre of music based on factors such as their major, if they’re in a relationship, their gender, if they played sports in high school, their favorite movie genre, if they use Apple or Android, and their favorite social media app. I will also be exploring other relationships in the data with various model types.

## Preparing the Data

The dataset was already in good condition when I got it (everything was cleaned and in a useable format), so the only data engineering I needed to do was to change Boolean responses to binary responses, and to use One-Hot Encoding on the categorical variables to make the readable for the model building algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

My first step in exploring the data was looking at each variable individually.

A few things that stood out to me here were some odd gaps in the histograms for the height variables, that some people didn’t learn the truth about Santa until they were teenagers, that a surprising amount of people thought the internet was around during WWII, and that more people are single than in a relationship. None of that is particularly ground-breaking but I still found it interesting.

My next step was to look at a correlation matrix for the numeric variables.

Obviously height, mother’s height, father’s height, and shoe size were pretty highly correlated. The hours of homework per week and number of credits also had a moderate correlation. But the one that stood out to me the most was a moderate correlation between height/shoe size and ideal future salary, which to me, suggests that men may be somewhat more zealous when it comes to their future careers. 

## Going Forward

Once I start building models to predict students’ favorite genre of music, I will build and compare such models as k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, and SVM. As stated above, this is my primary goal, but I will also use some unsupervised learning methods to look at other relationships in the data.
