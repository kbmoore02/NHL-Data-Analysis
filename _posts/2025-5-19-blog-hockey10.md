# Introduction

Now that the second round of the playoffs are over, lets look at some statistics for these games.

I used [this](https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_2025.html) website for my analysis. The code is basically the same as the first round analysis, I'm just using updated data.

## Goals Scored

In the second round, the Dallas Stars scored one less goal than the Winnipeg Jets, but they still won their series. The Carolina Hurricanes and the Florida Panthers had basically the same goal differential, but the Panthers scored a lot more total goals against the Toronto Maple Leafs than the Hurricanes did against the Washington Capitals. This is reflected in the goalie statistics.

Just in the second round, Stuart Skinner was the top goalie, with a save percentage of 94.4% and 1.28 Goals Against Average. This is incredibly surprising, given his poor performance in the first round - he had a save percentage of 81%, the lowest in the league. Despite his success in the second round, he is still 2nd to last amongst all goalies.
